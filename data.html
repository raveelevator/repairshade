You pay $1000 to go back in time 3 years and get mugged. And you tell me to face facts when you say &quot;Apple&#39;s screen is better, blah, blah, blah&quot; Now tell me, is that a fact or an opinion?? It would be a fact ONLY if you provide incorrect specifications and try to roast me with the wrong information.<br/> <br/><br/>YOU need to get your facts right. Don&#39;t reply to this, please. I&#39;ll just roast you again.</td>

Samsung never had FaceID, just an iris scanner, which is a different technology. It analyses the iris, not the face (hence the names). And by the way, the Lumia 950 was the first to have this.<br/> <br/><br/>The display is developed by Apple. It is the best display in any smartphone, better than S8 and Note 8. It is manufactured by a Samsung sub company. So the display does not have much to do with the phone company samsung.<br/> <br/><br/>I would say: get your facts right</td>

They do slow down the older phones, but it isn&#39;t without a reason. Most older phones have been out for years and people have had them for years. I had the original six until I got the Iphone X. The problem is with ANY older phone is that because of apps using more than ever before in terms of RAM, Etc. Most phones don&#39;t last 6 hour let alone a day.<br/> <br/><br/>While I don&#39;t agree that Apple hasn&#39;t offered the choice, it is a clever decision because that if you look on Apple&#39;s top reviews is the main complaint(Apart from the price, but those complaints aren&#39;t really viable or relatable to this).<br/> <br/><br/>Please in future, do not post illogical and radical conclusions without first inserting the slightest bit on knowledge.<br/> <br/><br/>Have a nice day, <br/> <br/><br/>DropDeadDreadmaw</td>

            <td>To sum up: The iPhone X is awesome device, and so are other iPhones. They maybe did had downsides like no wireless charging or lacks of features, but with recent iPhones that&#39;s not the case. Also the RAM managment and software optimization are unmatched. And security/privacy on iOS is much better too. <br/><br/>But, now there is the catch. It does cost a lot, which is also even understandable because of what it brings to the table. But at this price ranges, there shouldn&#39;t be much to complain about. But there is, from non expanding storage to iTunes and now to Apple slowing down old models performance. Say whatever you want - but they do that to make money, to force you to upgrade to better phone. Slow charger you get with iPhone X or removal of headphone jack is just an example of it. From no customization which sucks, now we are coming to other stuff that Apple does to make more money out of you. The same goes with the insane costs to replace front and/or back glass on new iPhones. They are innovative, and they could make even better products, but they are more interested in profit. And that&#39;s the reason why I personally don&#39;t have an iPhone, even though I like iPhones</td>

The soup WAS good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but the glory of my sandwich overshadowed the whole affair. <br/><br/>My friend even goes so far as to say that it is the BIGGEST regret of his adult life and that he has ordered the sandwich multiple times since then and that it has never been made to the same glorious standards as the first time he laid his envious eyes upon it.  He has since fallen out with me as I never let him taste even the smallest bite of this magical creation.  i have received several threatening emails and lewd phone calls asking me to explain the feelings associated with eating the sandwich of sandwiches.  I can only decline to do this as re-living this visceral experience will probably drive me to very edge of my own sanity, even the brief memory of the enticing aroma is enough to push me close to the greatest moment of my life and, in that moment, i maybe tempted to end my thoughts there and slip into the bliss that was the perfectly seasoned mayonnaise dressed Excalibur Sandwich, a Sandwich fit for a king.<br/> <br/><br/>But I can&#39;t, because I still have 19 months payments left on my phone.<br/> <br/><br/>Oh yes, and my friend thinks the phone is alright, but he likes traditional headphones soooo... </td>

In India Flipkart took deal for online sale . In the initial wave Flipkart may be had a stock of 1000 phones for the entire India .The entire pre order sold out in 3 minutes. Also the very day of the release the stocks went out in 5 minutes. People even went out and purchased the more expensive 256 GB in anticipation that Iphone X may not be available ever again. Well then reviews started pouring and and speed tests were live in Youtube and itit was the unanimous opinion that the mobile phone is unique and very good but never worth Rs 89000/- ( 1300 dollars for 64 Gb) . 1 month later the 2nd wave of sale took place and guess what , Iphone X is not selling like hot cakes anymore . Even worse that some websites have started giving discounts of 2000/- to 5000/- . Google understood its position and worth in the Indian market and Pixel 2 was discounted to Rs 39990/- . Long story short all those people who even travelled to Hong Kong so that they may sell in India at a profit made a royal fool of themselves. Apple also to rspect the Indian market and sell at a price not more than 65000/- . I guess another month more and the Iphone X will be discounted nevertheless.</td>

Tim Cook himself stated that Lcd retina displays are far superior than an Amoled display for color accuracy.&quot;<br/> <br/><br/>Because LCD has limitations like missing clear black, also it uses more power.

We buy Apple devices because they offer best tools for graphic designers, photographers etc. Apple cares stuff like that, just like they care about musicians which are also big favourite among music people.<br/> <br/><br/>Apple is always provided best tools for us creative people. How you think i can edit photo If it the look is already sowmthing how i shot it? I have no idea how it will look after i send it to another device If the devices colors were wrong from the beginning. This is exact same why musicians doesn&#39;t buy punchy speakers, they buy studio monitors which offers most balanced and natural sound. Not having too punchy bass or too crispy high end, the sound has to be perfectly flat and natural and sorry in mobile phones, Samsung doesn&#39;t offer that. That&#39;s why Apple had to redesign the screen to make it look like Apple users are expecting.</td>

I know some of these phones were released 1-1.5 years ago compared to iPhoneX and - with the exception of Google Pixel 2XL - they cost half as much as an iPhone while having similar or even better specifications. I mean, they all look good on paper, but I don&#39;t know how actually they are. If anyone has first-hand experience with any of these phones, I would really appreciate that. I&#39;d go for a  phone that is durable, technically reliable and takes nice photos indoors and outdoors. </td>

Imagine the bill apple would have to pay for such a tragedy, if apple new that there was a fault in every iPhone&#39;s battery they would do the same as Samsung did with the note 7 and call them all back. Don&#39;t even act like not none of Samsung&#39;s other batteries in other models don&#39;t swell vid believe me they do, I had a galaxy mega back in 2013 and bought 3 original Samsung batteries guess what they all swollen up. If only a couple of the galaxy note 7 batterys where reported setting on fire and not the rest that sold, what do u think Samsung would have done? Absoulty nothing just like apple, they would just blame the customer for missuse. Samsung only recalled them because they knew it was their stupid mistake. <br/></td>

The faceID on the IPhone X, while being clever, and iPhone must be congratulated for their obsessive pursuit to advance technology as should Samsung  (although they do get rewarded handsomely but that&#39;s an entirely different subject) <br/> <br/><br/>I quite like the fingerprint scanner on the S8&#39;s. I use a case (a folio case for protection...... (OMG don&#39;t get me started on the durability of flagships....that&#39;s a whole different debate) .... Yeah, I quite like the fingerprint scanner where it is, there&#39;s a cut out at the back and my finger naturally goes there as I take the phone from my pocket. I can genuinly have phone locked quicker than having scanner on the front......I feel that (only my opinion) the whole negative hype surrounding it&#39;s position is not representative of true opinion out there.....it&#39;s over blown.. That said, I have no doubts that some people  just don&#39;t like the scanner placed on the back. I get that. That&#39;s cool. <br/> <br/><br/>But <br/> <br/><br/>I would rather have a scanner on the phone than not.....and I like the bez-less designs and the Manufacturers are at this moment in time are not able to put a figerprint scanner under the screen. So I think it&#39;s a great compromise to have it on the back, rather than not having it at all. <br/> <br/><br/>The IPhone X doesn&#39;t even give you that option, and not only do you not have the fingerprint option, Apple have cut out a bit of the viewing area ( to me one of the, if not the most important thing) Yeah, they have cut out a piece of the screen. Now it might look distinctive and great for marketing as it stands out in the crowd ...yeah you will certainly notice it. ......but for me , it&#39;s a deal breaker...... big NO, NO. ...not good!! Not good at all and highlight to me that Apple had to make big decision, and I genuinly dont think they got those decisions right. <br/> <br/><br/>In Apples defence, they were under great pressure because of the 10th anniversary.... and this is the result. <br/><br/></td>

You can see on the official site that the 5.8&quot; measurement is for a rectangular screen while the X has rounded corners. But that&#39;s a minor quibble; the bigger issue is that there&#39;s a cutout at the top of the screen, which limits the usable area.&quot;<br/> <br/><br/>&quot;In fact, ignoring the top portion leaves a screen that&#39;s just about 18.5:9 in aspect ratio. If you were to show 16:9 content on it - the traditional widescreen format that all TV shows and YouTube videos use - you&#39;re left with what is effectively�a 4.96&quot; screen. That&#39;s obviously bigger than the iPhone 8&#39;s but way smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus display.&quot;<br/> <br/><br/>Source <br/>https://m.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_x-review-168�1p3.php#dt <br/> <br/><br/>As I said before, best thing to do is to pop into a shop and try them out side by side if you can. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></td>

Personally I like the latest trend of 19.5:9 ratio (X) and the 18.5:9 (e.g Galaxy S8) but it comes at a price e.g Videos are stretched or to see the videos as intended you will have to put up with black bars either side of the video you are watching and in doing so you don&#39;t make use of the full screen. Also you may want to take the &#39;notch&#39; into consideration too. <br/> <br/><br/>The IPhone 8 plus offers the more traditional 16:9 ratio,  but its all about preference and I would advise that you check the phones out in person if the screen is the big deal breaker for you. <br/> <br/><br/>Everyone has an opinion but there is only one opinion that matters and that is yours.</td>

I bought the Samsung S5 and i immediately loved the system, the screen quality and the performance. For Apple fanboys that say the Samsung have no long term quality or value, I used the S5 without problems until April 2017 and sold it for 200�?. I dont think that&#39;s bad. Now I have the Note 8 and I have some friends with Iphone X and I laugh really hard every time they need a powerbank and I still have 50% of battery. Also, these friends of mine always ask me to take photos because they think my camera is so much better. By the way, I sometimes can open my friend&#39;s Iphone X with Face ID and NO ONE EVER did it it my Iris Recognition on Note 8. I could continue, but I work in electronics retail and I&#39;m seing many more people changing from Apple to Samsung than from Samsung to Apple (this last is so rare that could be considered null). </td>

Sometimes it recognises, the other it doesn�?t even if u hold the phone in same circumstance ( light distance etc). And Touch ID was much faster. Apple should have given both in this model, and then gradually faze Touch ID out.  <br/><br/>Still it�?s new may it�?s doing the Machine Learning thing (haha) what apple is saying. It may improve over the period of time. </td>

I started with an s2 (about the same time as the iph4). It was a good phone but it started to get noticeably tired and slower into its second year. I replaced it with an s4 which was much better. It too got a little slower into its second year but not as bad as the s2. I replaced the s4 with an s6 and kept it for 2 years and it was perfect. No lags or slowing down, a massive improvement over the s2 and also an improvement over the s4. I now have an s8 and it is just superb in every way - speed, screen, camera etc. It certainly suits my purpose and proves that competition eventually brings out the best in everything. Iphone was the best and has improved with every new model. Samsung had to make massive improvements over the years to try reach the level of Apple. I believe that Samsung has now succeeded and I believe that both iphone 8 and Samsung s8 are pretty much equal.   </td>

            <td>The reason I stick with Apple year after year, even though they consistently fail to add or change features I would like and could have on an Android device, is stability. That�?s it. I need my phone to work, consistently, especially for the core functions of a communication device - email, text, Internet, messaging apps, etc.  I switched from Android with the iPhone 4 because it blew every existing Android device away in terms of speed and reliability in daily use.  Benchmarks are and were irrelevant to me; they don�?t console me when my phone freezes or reboots itself, when apps crash or fail to load or get sluggish, when messages mysteriously dissolve or fail to send.  These are problems I have never had on an iPhone. The �?it just works�? factor becomes really important when you rely on a device for critical communication for business. These days there are really impressive Android phones that seem to beat the iPhone out of the gate, even in actual speed tests and daily use case scenarios. But I know people who actually own those devices and I *still* see them stutter and fail at important tasks on occasion - something I literally never experience as an iOS user. Yes, bugs have creeped into iOS in recent iterations (which have generally been quickly squashed). But nothing which has caused slowdown or failure of essential tasks. And Android phones suffer from another frustrating problem I�?ve never experienced in iOS: slowdown over time. I�?ve never had to fully restore an iOS device to get it running without lag again. Ever. But that seems to be commonplace among Android devices. O don�?t have time in my life to be fiddling with my phone to get it running how I need it to work. Every cool and supposedly more convenient new feature that comes out on Android May seem like a reason to switch, but it always comes back to reliability for me. Over the course of my workday, I just need stuff to work how it should work when I want to use it, even if it�?s a fairly vanilla version of the thing. That�?s what keeps in in the iOS ecosystem. </td>

So what makes the iphone 8 so expensive to make. S8 has all the features of an iPhone 8 in fact more but yet cheaper to buy? That&#39;s with a Touch id scanner and Iris. Also another point Apple Removed &quot;Touch ID&quot; on the X which could of made the cost back for the new face ID.

Gone are those days ..iphone x is the future of smartphones.... Stocks sold within minutes in the world and remember it was not Mi this time it was iphone x yhe most expensive phone!! Even in US this phone is available in grey market forget abt the world!! The cost of second hand phone osore than the mrp.!!! Probably those who bought it are not fools.!!! Have a gud day!!</td>

            <td>Alex, 12 Nov 2017Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus<br/><br/>And iphone x should be iphone 8Yes I agree as I already said, Apple and Samsung were two of the last companies to hold the physical home button when everyone else adopted on screen buttons, this year both companies decided to get rid of home buttons in their flagships and what we got to know about each one&#39;s approach. <br/><br/>Samsung removed the home button but tried to keep the overall experience same for its users. The back button on right side tho it can be changed to left now. A recent apps button and a 3d touch always on home button which wasn&#39;t seen in any phone till now, iPhone 7 had it but it wasn&#39;t embedded in the display itself. So a Samsung user coming from older models like S5, S6 or S7 will get almost the same experience. The fingerprint sensor was put to back this time but the phone can still be unlocked the same way, press the always on home button without waking up the phone while looking at the display and the phone will be unlocked in no time by the iris scanner giving an impression of inbuilt fingerprint sensor. The bottom navigation panel with back home and recent buttons can be hidden easily by two taps tho the home button will still be functioning on pressing the area where it&#39;s embedded giving the same experience of physical home button while watching videos, playing games and using any app. The overall experience was enhanced by options like swipe down anywhere on display for notification panel and swipe up anywhere for apps, these settings can be changed according to taste.  <br/><br/>The other one is Apple which being the first company to bring 3d touch and a 3d touch home button in iPhone 7 strangely couldn&#39;t implement an always on 3d touch home button in display in their most premium phone till date. What they came up with is a swipe up line which is a user nightmare. To ruin it more there are things like swipe down from left of notch for notification, from right of notch for control center. The experience is no where near what people are used to and what they&#39;ll be using in future when inbuilt fingerprint sensor will come. The unlocking takes more time now due to the swipe even after face verification. Apple&#39;s rushed software approach for an anniversary edition makes an arrogant image of Apple. They are saying like&#39;&#39; if you want a phone which has demanded features samsung&#39;s display and bezel-less design then you&#39;ll have to pay extra and will have to accept unfinished non practical software. Otherwise keep buying what we are giving you from years and don&#39;t complain &#39;&#39;. I think and everyone thinks that iPhone x was supposed to be the main device of the year, they could name it as iPhone 8,X or anything but it was supposed to in the place of iPhone 8 as the next iPhone. It&#39;s a direct competitior to S8 which is a usual successor of previous device not an anniversary edition sold at premium price. Apple + amoled and unfinished software can&#39;t make it a more expensive device than the current iPhone of the year. I&#39;m sure iPhone 8 and 8 plus users who will spend a flagship amount will be left with a device which even the company doesn&#39;t approve as their current flagship. IPhone 8 wasn&#39;t supposed to come this year. IPhone x was supposed to be the main device.</td>

They could choose more expensive curved displays (570 ppi as in S8) but Apple decided to save cost and put a normal display in a curved glass panel which could easily fit a curved display as rumored earlier. Apple did the software tweaks and now the display is same as a lcd which means you get a lcd like oled with added risk of burn ins and lines as the software isn&#39;t revamped to avoid burn ins like Samsung do by slightly moving icons and buttons and moving always on features to avoid burn ins. Iphone x lcd like oled will definitely eat up eyes. </td>

            <td>Its iPhone tenth anniversary time and Apple had to think diffferent to commemorate it. The iPhone X attempts to setup a change in the design language and UI gestures for the next few years.  Of course when you have a massive user base making big changes means bringing those users with you. Yes things will probably change a bit based on user feedback, this is a Gen 1 product, and yes the software will catch up with the hardware - Animoji is just a fun proof of concept to push developers to come up with their own ideas.<br/> <br/><br/>Having finally got one (thanks istocknow.com for the live stock pushes!) my initial thoughts are this. Screen is something else. Oled looks very good, but Ive noticed my iPad Pro screen looks better in any light than my 6S plus scree, and this seems to prove Truetone/HDR is key.<br/> <br/><br/>I admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID (shame you cant register two faces - I guess the bionic ML hardware isnt fast enough - A12 anyone - or the software isnt up to it yet?), and its quicker to setup.<br/> <br/><br/>Speed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device but no comparison to a DLSR (though those can be thousands with good lenses!). However, its a big improvement on the 6S plus and I thought that had a good camera. <br/> <br/><br/>Is it worth the equivalent price of a 12 next week inch MacBook? Thats a personal decision but if you dont want to spend quite that much but want an iPhone, the iPhone 8 (and even 7) are mighty good phones with most of the functionality and very good LCD screens. But if you really really really want a X then consider the Apple Upgrade Programme. Its a way of paying monthly, its 0%, you get Applecare Plus, and you can upgrade to the Gen 2 product next year if you want or just continue paying it off.</td>

I&#39;ve used Windows and Android before.. I was so at home with Windows, but Microsoft killed the phone.. Android was bearable - a little annoying at times (with unexplained delays) - but was fine..<br/> <br/><br/>Then moved iPhone... Thought it is the greatest - I was wrong.. Even for basic operations - I was severely constrained. For instance, how do I take a backup of Photos physically (File copy) to PC ? It was virtually impossible unless you do it the &quot;iTunes&quot; way... And the backup to iCloud ? I paid close to USD1150 for this phone. And yet, I need to pay a subscription cost to iCloud - just for photo backup.. I paid unwillingly. <br/> <br/><br/>Go to iTunes, they try to hard sell Apple Music .. I just don&#39;t need it. <br/> <br/><br/>Let&#39;s not talk about Windows anymore.. It is more or less irrelevant. But it did much better job than the present day iPhones. <br/> <br/><br/>The only thing I &quot;like&quot; is there are enough apps. Something I missed in Windows. Android has plenty of apps - and more exciting title not found in iPhones. <br/> <br/><br/>I feel like using a rented phone with all these restrictions.. I feel severely restricted that I badly want to throw the phone to the ground and break it apart.. But I paid 1100 dollars and it offers a great snob value - and am keeping it purely because it tends to grab some attention.. I am being brutally honest.. I don&#39;t like the phone. But can&#39;t leave it because of the &quot;snob&quot; value. </td>

Camera is good enough, 4K videos at 30fps are not a problem. No optical zoom, true, but if that&#39;s needed, one should pick DSLR anyway, dual cam - useless. Screen resolution is much better, as it&#39;s standartized, unlike that of iP X. 5Mpix front camera is still OK for 1080p video.  <br/><br/>No stereo speakers, true, but unneeded. No NFC, true, but most cards are unsupported so not really needed. <br/><br/>No wireless charging, true, yet still it&#39;s not practical and voice recognition is governed by Google or third parties.  <br/><br/>On the other hand RMN4 has a headphone socket, IR port, 6 programmable buttons, fingerprint reader, dual sim and unlocked bootloader - all of which are more practical and all of which are lacking on iPhone X. <br/><br/>So your comparison doesn&#39;t really stand.</td>

Considering that this phone has a worse processor than a $200 &quot;Android&quot; phone and a price mark only high enough for laymen to pay for. You&#39;re truly something special if you spend more than a thousand dollars on a phone that has finally implemented true native HD into its phones base model (Not the + series). Maybe if you treated your phones with more care, its wouldn&#39;t have &quot;broke in 6 months&quot; You mention that the phone is glass and that you have to be more careful with it but we already know that you suck at taking care of phones since you can&#39;t own an android for more than 6 months. Apple has design flaws that they do not address! There are no vent ports in their products, their chip sets are cheap Chinese products and you keep falling into their money trap.  <br/><br/>Stop wasting your money to a horrible company that doesn&#39;t give a S*** about you unless you&#39;re giving them more of your money. They don&#39;t implement new technologies, they just steal it from other phone companies that aren&#39;t as recognized (ZTE, 1+, Xiaomi) but you wouldn&#39;t know that because of your Bias Apple opinion and your insufficiency to do research.  <br/><br/>You guys are such sheep. </td>

I would never buy a iPhone again but not because it is a bad phone! Just that I am used to the Android system. I hope all of you that buys this phone are happy with it and enjoy.

Mainly restriction for ask confirmation call before dial a call for the third party dialer app is so bad and annouing. That should be given as a option. I will not buy this phone only for that reason. Apple should consider on that. I am useing iphone 7 with 10.2. This is best ios version. Hope apple will give some solution for that. </td>

The face unlock  feature has been flawless it works during the day during the night I had no issues at all with it and it�?s extremely fast you look at it and you could swipe up as fast as you look at it it doesn�?t hesitate at all. I heard someone say when you hit the power off that there�?s a delay and that is far from  been  truth  it�?s instant on an instant off. All the apps everything is running very smooth all the games are flawless they love that Extra CPU speed that this has. If you�?re looking for an awesome phone at a fair market price this is a no-brainer you�?ve got to try one of these phones all I can tell you is I am so excited every time I turn on my phone and use it and I am very glad that I paid Just  A little extra for the Apple quality phone that you�?ll get.

This morning I have been using it and setting it up from scratch (did not want to restore from iP7+) and so far not once it failed to open even when I was outside sitting and my specs were darker (photochromic). I wont say it is a perfect phone, but put the unfavorable comments where it belongs - <br/><br/>- iPhone 7+ lasted a full day, iPX am charging now after 12 hours where 6 hours was not in use. and these 6 hour of up time is where full time screen was on. <br/><br/>- looks like battery % is gone  that was a useful item and I miss it. <br/><br/>- face id bit slow if you wait for it to unlocking than swap to go to apps, best way to unlock is to swap up immediately without waiting for Faceid this then have similar effect as touch id where moment u touch, it takes you to the apps. <br/><br/>- I still think the screen sq mm area would be in par with my ip7+ 5.5 inch screen as that one is wider than iPX.

I&#39;m getting my iphone x on the 3rd, the reason i&#39;m going for the x rather than the 8 is the screen and the fact that it will probably hold it&#39;s value better.

An always on 3D touch home button which simulates a real button for unlocking the phone and going back to home screen by pressing the home button area from any app, game or video. It also gives a feeling of under display fingerprint sensor as you can just press the home button and it&#39;ll be unlocked by iris or face recognition,  It&#39;s really strange that Apple who introduced 3d touch first is relying upon swiping which is very uncomfortable instead of providing a 3d touch home button </td>

An iPhone could have 2GB ram (like the 6s) and would still beat in terms of speed a 3,4GB ram android phone. Thats because of the iphone operating system smoothness and magic. You went from apple to android and thats why u think that 4gb ram is very much and will be very fast. If u take my advice, only worth to go from apple to android is to try a note samsung serie, or a Z5 even a s7 but huawei and shit like that are trash. If u like nexus designs they are okay too. I was an android user for 6 years as well and im on apple products now thats why i can tell the difference and the struggle with RAM bettween ios and android OS</td>

It has an OLED Display per Apple&#39;s Technical Specifications. https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/specs/  There have been some discussions which reflect Super AMOLED solved the screen burn problems associated with OLED Displays but I can tell you first hand my previous device, a Galaxy S7 Edge had the Super AMOLED Display and experienced a small amount of screen burn but much less the my Galaxy S6 device. I doubt there are any OLED, AMOLED or Surper AMOLED Displays which are immune to screen burn but some are a lot more resistant than others. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the iPhone X since most iPhone users keep their devices longer than their competitors. If iPhone X has screen burn issues we&#39;ll be hearing about them in less than a year.</td>

Super AMOLED outdoes its predecessor and other technologies in the same generation by integrating the touch-sensor component to the screen rather than being installed separately above it. Comparing it to AMOLED, its screen is essentially brighter and its power consumption is lower both by 20%. It also addresses the formers sunlight reflection downside by lowering it to 80%. In effect, it produces brighter and more vivid display regardless of external light intensity. Moreover, it promises wider viewing angle, superb outdoor readability and zero motion blurs with video or dynamic displays.</td>

I mean look at the HTC 10 that I bought for 266$. It is a pure awesome piece of tech for quarter of the price that Iphone X has. Yes, HTC 10 was pricy when it was first lunched, but this is the special thing about the Android market; Variety! You can&#39;t wait for the iphone 7 price to drop... It never will, simply because it&#39;s Apple. <br/><br/>But I can&#39;t say anything about it since people are accepting this price tag. It&#39;s just my personal preference. But in replay to you some android phones do match and surpass apple in everything other than processors.</td>

What I agree about that is RM5149 (USD1221) is truly expensive cuz most of Android flagships was 35% less pricier than the iPhone X cost. But what I disagree is this is 2017. Every year price will get higher and don&#39;t be suprise that after 10 years from now, iPhone XX (iPhone 20) will have higher price than one car XD</td>

Its just that I sort of &quot;look down&quot; on them for the things they get, thats all. They have cheaper things there, and yet they can&#39;t afford some things like the one I said previously, like seriously, or some cheaper ones that have a common standard price of high-end flagships better to say. This is just how I look on them sometimes, and one reason that made them like that is because of how their currency works, a smartphone cost around RM3000-4000 for high-end flagship and they earn slightly higher than that value. Their currency is all messed up. Sometimes I feel bad for them because of how their currency works, where smartphones are like more expensive than a television. I still wonder how many people will buy the IPHONE X there though</td>

Anything above 15% is easy to differentiate. I am sorry you do not like those facts, but there is no need to insult me and call me a troll when I am the only one who is saying the elephant in the room here, which is that Apple is giving you a less sharp display with the same effective size as the iPhone 8 plus and asking you 300 USD more.<br/> <br/><br/>See here for more details on actual display size:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Pqw8UBlUY <br/> <br/><br/>See here for more details on actual resolution (1126p--&gt;919p)<br/>https://medium.com/@suyashsrijan/1080p-pentile-i�s-not-true-1080p-9951b9e5c2ee <br/> <br/><br/>If Apple had made their premium phone premium with a truly bigger and sharper display, we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation! Instead they are faking the large size and also faking the increased sharpness AND lying to consumers by advertising the iPhone X as having a larger, sharper display!<br/> <br/><br/>Maybe instead of calling me a troll, look at what Apple are doing - maybe they are the money-grabbing troll there?<br/><br/><br/></td>

Power, 16 Sep 2017Well thanks no. <br/><br/>And about the thing what can human eye see ok.<br/><br/>But truth is the difference ... moreThe difference between the iPhone X (458ppi)and the LG V30 (537ppi) will be 17%, so quite significant. <br/><br/>The difference with the Sony XZ premium (801pp) will be 76%, or 92% once considering the pentile vs. RGB LCD difference, so it will be extremely visible.<br/> <br/><br/>There is no away around the fact that the sharpness on the iPhone X will pale in comparison to competition. The iPhone 8 Plus will be slightly better and more comparable to the 2K OLED displays out there, but even it will be dwarfed by the 2K RGB LCD displays.<br/><br/></td>

            <td>There�?s a growing trend in smartphone design that slices and dices the screen in shapes that stray further and further from the traditional rectangle. Rounded corners are a relatively tiny change and an old one at that (the Palm Pre had rounded corners). <br/><br/>But then companies like LG, Essential and then Apple started cutting off larger portions. LG did it to fit a �?secondary screen�? on the same line as the selfie camera, Essential just jammed the selfie camera in the top row of the screen and Apple was even more aggressive. <br/><br/>And our readers want none of that �? only a quarter of voters are okay with any sort of screen cutout. It�?s a roughly even split between those who only accept small cutouts and those that will agree to a big chunk of their screen being taken away in the name of a great feature. <br/><br/>Still, the overwhelming portion of the vote �? 60% - went to the Rounded corners option. It is curious that the traditional rectangular screen got relatively weak support. We think this means that rounded corners are in as a design element.</td>

The one I will sometimes refer to as iPhone X3.<br/> <br/><br/>Please Apple, no more &quot;s&quot; naming schemes. Just keep it Roman numerical every year.<br/> <br/><br/>2017 - X <br/><br/>2018 - XI <br/><br/>2019 - XII <br/><br/>2020 - XIII<br/> <br/><br/>Keep the naming simple even if the design is the same. X is able to reboot the naming for iPhones. Only the iPhone 4 was named properly for the generation it was released. The 4s, 5s, and 6s, ruined the generation order.<br/> <br/><br/>Being called iPhone XI (11) next year would also make it two numbers higher than the Galaxy S and Note line.</td>

And the list of gimmicks goes on.<br/> <br/><br/>The only thing I like right now about iPhone X is the camera and OS. But sometimes when I watch speed tests from YouTube, I&#39;m a little bit doubting on iOS software optimizations. GeekBench and AnTuTu stats for iPhone 8 (which has the same A11 bionic for iPhone X) is massively higher than Note 8. But on real tests, iPhone 8 is not twice as fast as Note 8. Both phones could even load apps at the same time.</td>

I mean, the software is kickass as always, but when we take a look at the hardware, I just have to see the iPhone 6 plus or the iPhone 7 plus in order to realize that they have a much better battery than the X. Not to mention the dimensions too.. it is thicker, heavier, etc. So, yeah, it has a new display (bought from Samsung), it has FaceID (exists since god knows when) and It has wireless charging (Samsung also has), AR(Asus ZenFone had before) and several other things. So, If i am to buy the new phone, I basically have to do it because of the AR and AI support. But AR, i have already seen and iOS 11 will also be available on your other device (the 6s plus), so besides from animating emojis and algorithms that calculate the camera real time, is that a reason enough to pay $1300 dollars (europe) for a phone that has wireless charging WHICH YOU HAVE TO BUY SEPARATELY? I mean come onnnnnnnnnnnnn... And when they say &quot;fully bezelless&quot; what the f*** does that mean, explain it to me,because i see bezels all around the display and there are some brands that have 1 bezel on the bottom, one on the top as well or just one and the X has them everywhere...

The price is justified with the following reasons.<br/> <br/><br/>1. The A11 chip is super fast, even par with latest MacBook pro performance. this phone will be fresh for next 5 years (I derived this from my iPhone 5S bought 4 years back but still working great specifically super fast with latest iOS 11)<br/> <br/><br/> 2. Apple continuously putting efforts to revamp the underneath stuffs. Example the current iOS 11 comes with AFS file system which is totally safe, reliable and provides super fast performance. They revamped the total File system that supports 4 years old phone too...<br/> <br/><br/>3. Apple support. If anything happens within the warranty period, no questions asked you can get a replacement<br/> <br/><br/>4. Also Apple is supporting the 4 year old iPhone 5s with the new image and file format that improves the quality as well as cut the image / video size to half. <br/> <br/><br/>5. The Note 8 also expensive with $930 and the iPhone comes with $999 tag. $70 difference only but you can get a phone for 5 year (if you are not tempted to buy new one between) I am sure after 2 years Note 8 will be slow down and eventually will die within 3 years.<br/> <br/><br/>You just think the above points and take a call whether the difference of $70 is expensive.<br/></td>

Or add extra ram for camera like Sony did in XZ Premium.  <br/><br/>Always nothing new just copied from other better brands and used in their garbage and for that they with no shame ask 1150 eur WTF.  <br/><br/>This company and all who stands behind it lost their minds !!!DEFINITELY!!!<br/></td>

Every other company, which has their own manufacturing facilities will do proper testing before releasing their products into market. Samsung is the sole manufacturer of iPhone X&#39;s AMOLEDs. So there is no question of copying here. Just get to know yourself about where Apple gets its parts from and then talk. 5.8&quot; screen in a body of 5.1&quot; phone, so that&#39;s not too big to handle. It&#39;s 174 g not 174 kgs to make users unable to carry it. I slightly agree with you on the design front though, they could have avoided the cutout and provided better design for the back. Those things would be corrected in its successor, if it ever gets one.</td>

My 6s was working like a charm till that dreadful day, and i only think 8s and Xs as definitely far better in performance. Only things i didn&#39;t like in iPhone X are as usual its exorbitant price tag and camera(even though Apple mentioned it as new sensor, but i feel it is a remodeled 7+ sensor).

            <td>Every year around this time Apple releases its new iPhones and every year we get a few early reviews in just before the phone goes on sale. <br/><br/>But this time, Apple has a more interesting phone coming out in November - the iPhone X - casting a shadow over the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - are they still worth it with a design dating back to 2014? Let&#39;s see what the reviewers say.<br/> <br/><br/>The consensus is that the Apple iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are let down by a tired design that&#39;s built on huge bezels and familiar aesthetics, but the new camera, wireless charging and chip partially make up for it. <br/><br/>Engadget praises the iPhone 8 duo on the new excellent camera and a promising AR implementation but takes a point away for the design, despite the use of &quot;grippier&quot; glass. <br/><br/>TheVerge makes mostly the same points - fast new processor, excellent camera and having wireless charging is nice. But Nilay Patel isn&#39;t too thrilled with the stiff design either. <br/><br/>TechCrunch focuses on the new camera of the iPhone 8 Plus in their review hailing the new 12MP main camera as killer and the 8 Plus&#39;s Portrait Lighting as &quot;working better than it has any right to&quot;. <br/><br/>The same theme continues with The Telegraph - praise for the significantly improved camera and the new faster chipset. The new glass back gets a positive mention too. <br/><br/>The New York Times review brands the new iPhones as the &quot;ultimate refinement before eternal retirement&quot;. <br/><br/>The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) is the only media that outright advises you avoid the iPhone 8 on the grounds that the 8 doesn&#39;t do enough to be considered more than a 7s, slightly better camera notwithstanding. <br/><br/>John Gruber aka the Daring Fireball brands the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus &quot;pretty good for a boring update&quot;. <br/><br/>CNET would have you wait to see the iPhone X before deciding on buying either an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. <br/><br/>In its brief write-up USA Today describes the new glass and metal design as &quot;lovely&quot;. <br/><br/>Wired shares TechCrunch&#39; sentiment that the new camera is kick-ass. It also hails the glass design as a big improvement coupled with wireless charging. <br/><br/>Anyway we&#39;ll have even more to say when we get our hands on the new iPhones - camera samples, battery tests, loudspeaker test - all that jazz. So stay tuned!</td>

Just ... moreThis type of charging is easier to implement outside, as there is no need to care about what ports you have, and you don&#39;t need to carry wires.<br/> <br/><br/>And to add to that since Apple is also on the Qi standard and adding new protocols, we will see the rise of wireless battery packs, that can recharge wirelessly on those pads, as well as charging your phone on the go. And maybe lead to power sharing, putting phones to each other or battery packs to each other will charge the lower battery ones.<br/> <br/><br/>And if you have enough of such places around charging your phone faster then usage, you will not feel the restriction you say. Unless you are the type that uses your phone 24/7 without a single rest... then i call that over addiction.</td>

Especialy when used for 4k recording because lot of people will try that and they will be shocked how fast the phone died i mean battery.  <br/><br/>For Example Sony Z5 premium on 4k lasted like 45-50 mins and battery died. And it had 3430 mAh. When i look at all previous apple phones noone had battery over 2000 mAh. Apart from 7plus 2900. But for almost 6 inch screen it will be like joke i mean battery capacity.  <br/><br/>For example oukitel K10000 pro have 10150 mAh battery 5,5 inch screen 3GB ram 32 Gb disk space 8 core processor and cost only 220 eur. </td>

Personally, on the internet I think it looks nice enough, though if place it behind both the galaxy phones and the mi mix. In real life I might like it more, I didn&#39;t like how tall and thin the s8 was. Plenty of people will consider this the most beautiful phone - especially those with Samsung hate.<br/> <br/><br/>The processor is a gamble. On paper, it looks to be a huge leap on existing tech. But you&#39;re correct that it&#39;s had limited testing, can&#39;t wait to see the heat generation.<br/> <br/><br/>Copy Samsung&#39;s screen? It is Samsung&#39;s screen - nothing wrong with that. Probably the best mobile screens around, so good going Apple.<br/> <br/><br/>Overall, I think the phone is nothing exciting, but it does compete with the best phones out there. Apples planned augmented reality future seems a bad choice to me, buy here&#39;s hoping they do something good with it.

People don&#39;t really get it in general. <br/><br/>It&#39;s not the hardware specs that make a product a great one. What you are going to do with the product matters more than raw power. You could have 16 core CPU and a 16GB RAM on your phone but what&#39;s the point if you can manage to pull off most tasks that are available today with just 2 or 3GB RAM tops. Take Samsung&#39;s face detection based unlock for example. People could easily break it with a simple photo/picture to unlock. Apple has gone really far in order to make face ID fool proof. At least they have attempted. We&#39;ll know how secure it is once the phone is out and security enthusiasts take a dig at it.<br/> <br/><br/>My point is not to criticise you or your opinion.

Blazing processor speeds aren&#39;t truly discernible unless the device is in hardcore gaming environments. For these applications AnTuTu speeds are the most useful measure of user experience. The A11 still tops the charts at 226,000 compare to 182,000 for the Spapdragon 835 or about 20% faster. What isn&#39;t mentioned is bloatware, which Apple doesn&#39;t allow on it&#39;s iPhones. Custom ROM&#39;s are now available for Android devices which can eliminate the bloatware allowing a much faster and smoother user experience. On a pure Android Software Device the A11 CPU doesn&#39;t have any real advantage and when the Qualcomm&#39;s 936 Prototype is released next year Apple hasn&#39;t shown it&#39;s flexible enough to counter with a better CPU anytime in the near future. </td>

Trade in my iPhone 7+ 128GB for 500 and I have a singtel coupon for 120. So just have to pay S$18. Thank god don&#39;t have to find couple of kidneys to sell.  <br/><br/>hopefully the face id would be much better implemented then the Android, where twins could unlock it and in some case even the photo can unlock it. At night full bright screen used as light to see your face. Apple so far looked like have taken care of these issues. Apple adapt tech late but implementation is perfect. </td>

In this specific context is basically the computer programmed translation of a number of mathematical and statistical (complex) concepts.  <br/><br/>Let&#39;s try a simplification. Imagine to have a software that, whenever a red square is presented, it returns the word &#39;Red&#39;. Then you change a little bit the input color so it is very close to the original red. And you program the software to write again &#39;Red&#39;. Then you extend this &#39;learning&#39; path of this computer software so that a number of degrees of differences of the original red is sill mapped to the output word &#39;Red&#39;. At the end of this learning process your software will be able to &#39;recognize&#39; an input color and decides if it has to return the &#39;Red&#39; word as output or another string. Now, substitute the input color with the dots that map your face and the output string returned by the software with the lock/unlock mechanism of the new iPhone and here you are... <br/><br/>In reality this a very complex topic but my small and poor example can help. :-)</td>

            <td>With iPhone X preorders in 6 weeks and availability sometime after that, it leaves a large window for discussions about the pros and cons of this device. Apple is for the most part targeting current and past iPhone users. They&#39;re not likely to attract many crossover android users since most of the new features on this device have been components on android smartphones for some time now at a significantly lower price point. Facial Recognition, Wireless Charging, Imersive LED Display and Glass Body among others. A good portion of the early debate has revolved around cost. Even longtime iPhone devotees are going to think twice about the cost/value metric. Not only for the X flagship between $999.00 and $1,149.00 but even more so for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus which are priced at $699.00 and $799.00 respectively. By the time you buy Earpods, Lighting Dock, Wireless Charger and a Case you&#39;ll have invested over $1,300.00 for the 64 GB and $1,450.00 for a 256 GB iPhone X and between $1,000.00 to $1,100.00 for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Currently you can purchase a new iPhone 7 Plus in the mid $400.00 range. The new iPhone offerings are no doubt great devices but even hardcore applehead&#39;s will give flagship android devices a good look before they throw down that much cash on their next smartphone.</td>

It has actual 3D mapping capabilities and no this is totally different to Windows Hello. This supposedly even works with glasses!<br/> <br/><br/>This is another Apple Legacy that will have EVERYONE follow, just like how they perfected TOUCH ID.<br/> <br/><br/>I have an S8 plus and seriously thinking of selling to go back to iOS. Android with all its customisation appeal do not have anywhere near the quality of apps and ecosystem of Apple.<br/> <br/><br/>LOL and Apple will once again pioneer AR and not Google with that Project Tango that no other OEM cared for.

And looks stunning!!! ( Thanks to Samsung helping them with the display ).<br/> <br/><br/>New features I like:<br/><br/> <br/><br/>First: I love how they did the AR function! I think this is a game changer for the industry!!!    ( And it&#39;s also something I&#39;ve been wanting to see since the first mention of ar technology ), but being able to play games and display cool inserts to a video while recording is absolutely mind blowing!!! And I can&#39;t wait to get my first hands on experience, to test it out!!!<br/> <br/><br/>Second: The new animoji feature is totally sick!!!! Just being able to custom adjust your emogi with your facial expressions is absolutely amazing!!!! ( I would however like to see more emoji options than the 12 given ), maybe in future updates???<br/> <br/><br/>And last but not least: I am so happy Apple finally went wireless!!!! ( It&#39;s about time! No Offense... ), but none the least a great step to the future of iphone.</td>

No 4K display (2160p), not even 1440p only 1125p???<br/> <br/><br/>With its massive display the iPhone X is one of the flagship phone with the smallest pixel density 458ppi vs. 537ppi for the LG V30 or 521ppi for the Note 8.<br/> <br/><br/>Based on this it is obvious to me that Apple don&#39;t take augmented reality seriously. How would Android fans turn to Apple when they persist in their avoidance of high resolution displays?<br/> <br/><br/>LG was able to fit a 3300mAh battery in a really thin device. Why can&#39;t Apple finally build a battery in that will allow them to have better autonomy at high resolutions and deliver a more comfortable augmented reality experience? <br/> <br/><br/>It could have been a justified choice if they were going to make the phone a battery beast (what everyone is craving for the moment) but they haven&#39;t even provided the battery capacity yet, so don&#39;t even expect them to use the smaller display resolution to outperform Android in terms of autonomy. Lost opportunity in my opinion.<br/> <br/><br/>The Note 8 is too heavy and I don&#39;t like the elongated square design that much. <br/><br/>The iPhone X doesn&#39;t join the high resolution display club and won&#39;t have the crazy batter size that people were hoping for. <br/><br/>Neither have an emphasis on audio quality.<br/> <br/><br/>For me it will be either LG V30 or Axon 9. As much as I love the LG V30, I would prefer a dual stereo speaker setup but it will depend on ZTE&#39;S ability to fit them in a bezelless design.<br/> <br/><br/>But at least those two brands put on emphasis on audio and microphone quality. What good is great camera if the recorded sound is not even remotely professional grade?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></td>

Had nearly every Android flagship in last 10 years. Only stayed away from Apple due to large screen to body ratio (and not only Apple to be fair - Sony and few others are on the list as well.)  <br/><br/>This time we have serious IPhone available and I am tempted for first time in years. Say what you want about IOS but it is still most stable and most supported system for phones/tablets. Maybe you don&#39;t use any pro apps but if you do you will find out that Android is poor at best - I work in music industry and what IOS achieved around music based apps is unbelievable. And this is possible due to stability and great IOS - no Android app is able to run steadily enough so it can be used for live music like we use on iPads - and that is a sign of great system. Sometimes is not about numbers but about reliability. I have LG G6 and Samsung S8 right now and both these things started to slow down and random moments and that is only about 3 months into use.
